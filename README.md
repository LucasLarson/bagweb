Active projects need active websites, and this often means a CMS of 
some kind (WordPress, MediaWiki, Drupal). But projects end, and so
does the write activity on a website.

To keep a record of the project you can be stuck keeping the CMS software up to
date so it doesn't get hacked, and making sure the database is upgraded and
backed up. As the Web gets older, this problem gets [worse].  Wouldn't it be
nice to replace the once dynamic site with a static version that wouldnt'
require software updates of any kind?

bagweb is a utility script for mirroring a website and writing the data into
a [bagit] package for your data archive. The heavy lifting is done by [wget]
and [bagit.py] so you'll need to have those installed. bagweb really isn't
anything special, it's just a way of remembering a sequence of command-line
interactions.

    % bagweb http://mith.umd.edu/api-workshop/ api-workshop
    
    time passes ...

    % tree -L 2 apiworkshop
    apiworkshop
    ├── bag-info.txt

    ├── data
    │   ├── apiworkshop.warc.gz
    │   └── mith.umd.edu
    ├── manifest-md5.txt
    └── tagmanifest-md5.txt

CAVEAT: If the website being archived has a lot of dynamic AJAX stuff going on,
the mirror copy may not be perfect, because wget doesn't execute JavaScript. But
it may work good enough for you, considering the alternatives.
